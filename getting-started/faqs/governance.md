## How do I vote?

Voting takes place on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer), an off-chain, gasless voting system. Snapshot was created by Balancer Labs, and has become a very successful multi-protocol voting system trusted by over 600 teams.

## What do I need to be eligible to vote?

The three current sources of voting power are:

* Holding BAL in your wallet
* Holding BPT in your wallet for a Liquidity Pool with BAL in it
* Getting voting power delegated to you by another wallet

It is worth noting that Balancer Governors have the ability to vote on adding/removing strategies of how to assign voting power.

## When are votes?

Votes happen when there is a proposal to vote on; they are not regularly scheduled. When they are active, votes typically occur over the weekend. They are announced on the forums, on Discord and on Twitter.

## Is BAL on Tron?

No, there is no token on Tron affiliated with the Balancer Protocol. The token in question is affiliated with a phishing site.
