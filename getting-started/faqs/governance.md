## How do I vote?

Voting takes place on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer), an off-chain, gasless voting system. \(TODO: shill that it's a Balancer spinoff?\)

## What do I need to be eligible to vote?

**TODO: is this going to remain the same as V1 or is staking going to be required for some eligibility?**

The three sources of voting power are

* Holding BAL in your wallet
* Holding BPT in your wallet for a Liquidity Pool with BAL in it
* Getting voting power delegated to you by another wallet

## When are votes?

Votes happen when there is a proposal to vote on; they are not regularly scheduled. When they are active, votes typically occur over the weekend. They are announced on Discord and Twitter. \(TODO: other places votes are announced?\)

## Is BAL on Tron?

No, there is no token on Tron affiliated with Balancer. The token in question is affiliated with a phishing site.
