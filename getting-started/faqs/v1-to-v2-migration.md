# V1 ‚ûù V2 Migration

## How do I migrate from V1 to V2?

For two-asset pools, you can automatically migrate your liquidity from comparable pools. More details about the migration process will be released closer to the official UI launch.

For pools with more than two assets, we recommend manually removing liquidity from V1 and re-adding your liquidity to V2.

## Do I have to migrate? What happens if I don't?

Balancer V1 is not being "turned off" \(it can't be\), so if you choose not to migrate, your liquidity will remain in the older trading pools. Trade aggregators will likely still consider V1 pools when looking for the cheapest prices, but as liquidity falls and price slippage increases, it may not be worth the gas fees for them to use those pools.

Balancer V1 pools will continue earning trade fees, but the BAL governance distributions will transition to V2.
