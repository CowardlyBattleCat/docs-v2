# About Balancer Protocol and Labs

## What is Balancer Protocol?

Balancer Protocol is an automated market maker \(AMM\) protocol built on Ethereum. It facilitates trades as a decentralized exchange, and supports liquidity providers by allowing anyone to create and supply trading pools.

## Who benefits from Balancer Protocol?

Balancer offers value to all parts of the liquidity ecosystem — a self-balancing portfolio for investors, a deep liquidity source for traders, and an efficient bootstrapping tool for issuers.

## What networks does Balancer Protocol run on?

Balancer is deployed on Ethereum and Polygon. On Ethereum, the protocol exists on mainnet and the many testnets.

There are no implementations on Tron, or any other networks. Balancer Labs has awarded grants to teams developing on Near and Algorand; however, these are exploratory grants, and does not imply that there are working versions of Balancer Protocol on these systems.

## Who is behind Balancer Labs?

The team behind the Balancer Protocol \(Balancer Labs\) has been in the DeFi space for a while, and started Balancer as a research project in early 2018.

They have proven that they can ship and maintain a successful DeFi product that is driven by decentralized governance. The team has shown that they respect and care about the ethos of the industry. This collaborative mindset made them built [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), an open-source tool that allows for gasless voting which became the de-facto standard for decentralized governance voting with 800 projects using it as of writing.

Currently there are ~25 Balancer Labs employees, mostly on the Development side with a small but mighty Community, Engagement, and Partnership team.

## **What’s the relationship between Balancer Labs and Balancer Protocol?**

Balancer Labs is the organization founded to start implementation and evolution of Balancer Protocol. Since its inception, the code has been open sourced under GPL3.0 license. Balancer Labs' mission is to create a network and community strong and reliable enough to dissolve the company and hand all the responsibilities to the Balancer Community, creating a true DAO.
