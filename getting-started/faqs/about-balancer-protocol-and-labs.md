# About Balancer Protocol and Labs

## What is Balancer Protocol?

Balancer is an automated market maker \(AMM\) protocol built on Ethereum. Balancer allows for its trading pairs \(called pools\) to consist of multiple tokens — anywhere between 2 and 8, each token with a different arbitrary share of the pool \(from 1% to 99%\). This is different than how 50/50 AMMs \(e.g Uniswap\) rely on the x\*y=k equation in that it allows different, varying impermanent loss schemes and capital efficiency according to the specific use case.

## Does Balancer have a token?

Balancer's governance token is BAL, which gives holders decision making power over the protocol and a share of any protocol fees collected.

The BAL token is deployed at [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d)

## How does the self-balancing index fund work?

Enabling almost zero trading fees for Pools, Balancer can enable creation a sort of self-balancing index fund. It is an inverse of an exchange traded fund \(ETF\). In an ETF you’re paying a portfolio manager to keep balancing the ETF as prices of its consisting assets inevitably change. In Balancer, you, as a liquidity provider, get paid when the ETF is rebalanced automatically.

This works because market actors are incentivized to rebalance the portfolio so as to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. Their fees are what pays you as the investor in the fund. The rewards come in the form of Balancer Pool Tokens \(BPTs\).

## Who benefits from Balancer Protocol?

Balancer offers value to all parts of the liquidity ecosystem — a self-balancing portfolio for investors, a deep liquidity source for traders, and an efficient bootstrapping tool for issuers.

## Who is behind Balancer Labs?

The team behind Balancer \(Balancer Labs\) has been in the DeFi space for a while, having started Balancer as a research project in early 2018.

They have proven that they can ship and maintain a successful DeFi product that is driven by decentralized governance. The team has shown that they respect and care about the ethos of the industry. This collaborative mindset made them built snapshot.page, an open-source tool that allows for gasless voting which became the de-facto standard for decentralized governance voting with 600 projects using it as of writing.

Currently there are 25 Balancer Labs employees, mostly on the Dev side with a small but mighty Community, Engagement and Partnership team.

## **What’s the relationship between Balancer Labs and Balancer Protocol?**

Balancer Labs is the organization founded to start implementation and evolution of Balancer Protocol. Since its inception, the code has been open sourced under GPL3.0 license. Balancer Labs' mission is to create a network and community strong and reliable enough to dissolve the company and hand all the responsibilities to the Balancer Community, creating a true DAO.
