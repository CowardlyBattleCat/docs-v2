# Welcome

Balancer is an automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor.

Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of a paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.

Balancer is based on an [N-dimensional invariant surface](https://balancer.finance/whitepaper/) which is a generalization of the constant product formula described by Vitalik Buterin and proven viable by the popular Uniswap dapp.

Balancer V2 brings powerful new features to slash gas costs, super-charge capital efficiency, unlock arbitrage with zero-token starting capital, and open the door to custom AMMs.
